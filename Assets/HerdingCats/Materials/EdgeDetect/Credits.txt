I did not make this, although I did modify the code quite a bit to get the right look and feel.

I didn't have time to request this as a third-party add on, but since newer versions of Unity have this as a default feature of the shader graph,
and I cannot use the shader graph for my cat shader since it is currently broken and does not support vertex shading, I figured that this would be 
acceptable as it is essentially just a fix for a broken unity feature.
